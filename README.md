# Statistics in Python

This repository is intended to serve as a fundamental course in statistics. The goal is to learn how to apply theoretical concepts using the Python programming language in order to wrangle data and solve real-world problems.

This repository will cover five topics.
1. Central limit theorem
2. Sampling distributions (mean and variance)
3. Chi-square, t and F distributions
4. Hypothesis tests and confidence intervals
5. Linear Regression (more to come)

I update this repository frequently. Some incoming changes are the inclusion of a chapter dedicated to the binomial, Poisson and exponential distributions. For any requests, bugs or errors, please feel free to raise an issue or contact me directly.
